## **App Description**

Our app is a landing page that will visualize Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure around the world and highlight important manufacturing information. We will utilize an interactive global map to display the locations of 5000 EV charging stations, allowing you to zoom in to see individual data points. When you hover over a data point, you will be able to see the address of the station as you hover and a plot will be generated below showcasing important features about that station such as connector type, charger type, station operator, usage, availability, cost, etc. We hope to display this in a table, allowing easy user readability. 

There will also be a panel allowing users to filter the data using various drop down menus or a range bar based on specific metrics such as city, connector type, year built, etc. In addition to displaying the filtered data points on the map, summary statistics will populate in another panel below, such as average cost or the count of connector types. These summary statistics will allow users to compare EV stations based on their filtering criteria. Below is a sketch of our proposed app design. Our app is highly interactive, with each panel linked to at least one other panel.
