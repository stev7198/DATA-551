## **Resolutions**

In the event of unacceptable behaviour we will follow the following framework to resolve the issue. The first step will be to identify the unacceptable behaviour and collect detailed information for further review. Next, the issue should be brought forward to the team during the next team meeting. The team should review the code of conduct to identify specifically the issues with this behaviour. Depending on the severity of the incident, there should be an initial warning for the offender. If the behaviour continues then this should be escalated to the relevant authorities at the university.
