# **Team Work Contract and Collaborative Documentation**

All team members are expected to contribute equally and provide their best effort. The work will be distributed equally by dividing each project milestone into 3 tasks, with each group member responsible for completing a task. Tasks will be delegated based on group members interest. We will rotate the type of task each milestone so that each group member gets a chance to work on a different aspect of the project. 

We plan to have group meetings once a week during the scheduled lab time and additional meetings over zoom as needed. We won’t have formal meeting agendas but instead communicate over slack about what we need to discuss during the meeting. Meetings will also be used to go over any concerns or difficulties experienced with a given task or the project overall. Our expected workflow will be to discuss tasks during the meeting and divide them, and have them completed later that week. Once on the repo, group members can look over each other’s work and give feedback if needed. Our expected work hours for the project are 12:30 pm - 6:00 pm on weekdays. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, our work hours will change to 9:00 am - 5:00 pm. Our expected form of communication is Slack and in-person.

If a group member finds any difficulty with their given task, they are encouraged to use their group members for help. Although we are dividing tasks and completing them individually, we are collaborating on this project and should help each other as needed. Furthermore, all group members are expected to let the others know if they are sick or unable to make the weekly meeting, or if they are unable to meet a task deadline.
